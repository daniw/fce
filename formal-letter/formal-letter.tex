\begin{g-brief}
In an English language newspaper I saw your advertisement for people to work 
for the International winter school on "`'Design Thinking"'. As I was tutor for 
the module electrotechnics 1 at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and 
Arts last semester, I have some expirience working with students. I achieved 
the First Certificate in English in 2010. Since then I took no English class. 
But I use English sometimes for my actual job when engineers from abroad 
arrive to test our devices. Because I made an apprenticeship as electronics 
technician and also used English in a technical context, I see my position 
either as technical supporter or as assistant especially for students studiing 
electrotechnics.
